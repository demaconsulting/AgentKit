# Introduction

This document provides the verification design for AgentKit, a family of .NET libraries providing
hardened, provider-neutral agent tools.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to serve as the verification design entry point and document how
requirements will be tested across all software items in the AgentKit system. This
documentation enables formal review by mapping every requirement to named test scenarios, supports
compliance auditing by providing clear traceability from requirements through verification design
to tests, and ensures test completeness can be assessed without reading implementation code.

This document is intended for:

- Software developers implementing and maintaining tests
- Code reviewers validating test completeness against requirements
- Compliance auditors tracing requirements through verification design to tests
- Quality assurance teams validating test coverage and scenario adequacy

## Scope

This document covers the verification design for the AgentKit system and its
constituent software items, specifically:

- **AgentKitCore (System)** — The contract package every other AgentKit package depends upon
- **RealPathResolver (Unit)** — Reports the real file system location a path reaches, resolving
  symbolic links and directory junctions at every path component
- **PathRule (Unit)** — One access rule, unrestricted or confined to a location, carrying its own
  denied patterns
- **PathPolicy (Unit)** — Pairs an independent read rule and write rule, and makes the single
  containment decision used by both direct access and directory enumeration
- **ToolLimits (Unit)** — The ceilings every governed tool observes when reading, returning and
  attaching content
- **ToolResult (Unit)** — The results a guarded tool returns to the model, including refusals
- **ToolName (Unit)** — The family-prefix naming convention and its validation
- **GuardedToolFactory (Unit)** — The only supported way to construct a tool, applying the
  result-delivery guard and the naming rules to every tool it creates
- **ToolPack (Unit)** — The contract a package implements to publish its tools as one
  capability-gated family, and the host capabilities a pack may require
- **ToolPackBuilder (Unit)** — Capability-gated composition of tool packs into the tool list an
  application offers a model
- **AgentKitTools (System)** — A general-purpose capability package of guarded tool families
  built on the AgentKitCore contract; its tool families are introduced in subsequent increments

The following OTS items are also covered:

- **BuildMark** — build-notes documentation tool
- **FileAssert** — document assertion tool
- **Pandoc** — Markdown-to-HTML conversion tool
- **ReqStream** — requirements traceability tool
- **ReviewMark** — file review enforcement tool
- **SarifMark** — SARIF report conversion tool
- **SonarMark** — SonarCloud quality report tool
- **SysML2Tools** — architecture model lint and diagram rendering tool
- **VersionMark** — tool-version documentation tool
- **WeasyPrint** — HTML-to-PDF conversion tool
- **xUnit** — unit-testing framework

This verification documentation covers the same software items as the design documentation.

Version applicability: This verification design applies to all versions of the AgentKit.

The following topics are explicitly excluded from this verification documentation:

- Build pipeline and CI/CD process testing
- Infrastructure and hosting environment testing

## Companion Artifact Structure

Each software item covered by this document has corresponding artifacts in parallel directory
trees. In-house items have artifacts in these parallel locations:

- Requirements: `docs/reqstream/{system}/.../{item}.yaml` (kebab-case)
- Design docs: `docs/design/{system}/.../{item}.md` (kebab-case)
- Verification design: `docs/verification/{system}/.../{item}.md` (kebab-case)
- Source code: `src/{System}/.../{Item}.cs` (PascalCase for C#)
- Tests: `test/{System}.Tests/.../{Item}Tests.cs` (PascalCase for C#)

OTS items have parallel artifacts in:

- Requirements: `docs/reqstream/ots/{ots-name}.yaml` (kebab-case)
- Verification: `docs/verification/ots/{ots-name}.md` (kebab-case)

Review-sets: defined in `.reviewmark.yaml`
